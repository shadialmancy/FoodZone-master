> Food Ordering Management System PHP &amp; MySQL Project

### Summary of the System: 
There is a lot of scope online food ordering business and we can tap it to the max extent possible as everyone has access to an online ordering facility via the internet. Food business usually will have high demand and hence online business prospect for food ordering should be profitable.  We will provide an easily accessible interface wherein the customer can view and place the order easily.

The customer can register initially with minimum details and will be allowed to check the menu items before ordering them, adding them to cart and submit the order. The system records the details in MySQL database so that it will be easy to retrieve later. The users of the system also include employee/admin who will handle info related to product addition and assigning vehicle for placed orders.

### Problem Statement:
The food business in restaurants is being carried out in the same fashion for so many decades. In the restaurants, when the customers visit, they will read the large menu cards which just has the name of the item and price. They have to decide in moments time and place the order just to wait in the queue for getting the ordered items on their table. Sometimes, the waiting time is so huge that the customers will actually lose interest in the item. Moreover, some customers will be in their office or busy to come physically to the restaurant and eat. 
To ease the process of ordering the items, giving a description of each item and getting the item on the table the online food ordering system is designed. Some of the common problems are listed below.
The general problems faced while ordering food physically in a restaurant are listed below.
Viewing the complete description of the menu item before ordering.
Placing the order standing in a queue.
Waiting for the customerâ€™s turn to get the food.
These hurdles will be avoided by placing the order online

### Users of the System:
The users of the system include the customers and the employees. The employees of the system are responsible for updating the menu items as well as the delivery of the item to a particular address. The customers will visit the website, check for the items available in the menu, order for one or more items in the menu. All the activities such as ordering items online, delivery of the items by employees, the vehicle used to deliver the items etc. will be recorded in the database for all the events.

### Users of the database:
The top-level management who owns the food business will be using the database. They can try to infer details like

1. the most demanded item 
2. item not ordered at all
3. amount of business is made on daily basis
4. the number delivery of items is being carried out
